# Remote Pi FM
This is an Android App which allows you to control you Raspberry Pi (3B+ prefered) in combination with the [PiFmRds Project](https://github.com/ChristopheJacquet/PiFmRds). 
I made this app beccause I wanted to be able to control everything from my Smartphone. I once made a C# Application which is exactly like this app but was a WinForm App 
that I've emulated using mono on the Raspberry Pi. It worked, but my Touchscreen stopped working for the Pi.

This was originally a private repo, but since some of my friends say this is really cool I thought I'd try publishing it. I hope this App is going to help you somehow or makes
controlling it easier.

## App Store
I've submitted this Application to Google Play and Amazon's App Store. Therefore don't just copy it and publish it on your own. Since I already submitted it and I don't like 
the idea of someone copying and republishing my app. See the license file anyway.

## Features
- Wireless SSH connection to your Raspberry Pi
- Play and Stop FM Broadcast
- Select <b>uploaded</b> files to play
- Set your custom frequency
- Convert uploaded .mp3 files to .wav
  - Also converts file names (spaces are being removed, brackets will be also removed etc...)
  
<br>

## Planned Features
- Save connections
- Upload files via App (implemented but disabled, else it would crash app)
- Auto-Installer (e.g. automatically install PiFmRds, sndfile lib, etc..)

## About Updates
I've planed to keep updating this app and add new features. When everything works fine I've planed to clean up the code and improve it. For now it is a little bit messy, but this will be fixed! This is my ever first android app.

## Download
If you want to download <b>the app</b> (=apk file), [click here](https://github.com/hackthedev/remotepifm/releases/download/1.1.1/app-release.apk). You have to have "Unknown Sources" to be enabled or wait until my submission on Google Play Store was approved and download it from there.
